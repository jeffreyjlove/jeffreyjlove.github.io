# Jeffrey J Love

I am an MPhil Candidate in International Relations at the University of Oxford. I use large language models and natural language processing techniques to investigate the effects of sanctions and economic statecraft. My thesis is supervised by Dr Ranjit Lall.

I hold a BSc in International Relations from the London School of Economics. I wrote my undergraduate dissertation, "Nationalization as a Strategy to Resist Economic Sanctions," on the political and economic methods that leaders use to counteract sanctions under the supervision of Dr Nikhil Kalyanpur.

I am a research assistant with the European Studies Centre's Dahrendorf Program and I have work experience with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the US State Department, the Global Public Policy Institute, KingSett Capital, and London Politica. I am the Co-Editor in Chief of the Oxford Diplomatic Dispatch, the former General Section Editor for the St Antony’s International Review (STAIR), and the GCR Vice President for Academics at St Antony’s College.
